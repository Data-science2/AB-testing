# AB-testing
In this project, we conducted a comparative analysis between the old website and the newly developed one to assess its potential for increasing sales. Our objective was to determine whether it is worth implementing the new website or if further investigation is required before making a decision. To evaluate this, we employed statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and graphical representations.
